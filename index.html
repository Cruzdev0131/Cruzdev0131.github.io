    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I'm a third-semester Computer Systems Engineering student at the National Technological Institute of Mexico, Morelia Campus. In high school, I graduated as a Programming Technician, which combined with my current studies, has given me four years of programming experience. Over the past year, I've been using GNU/Linux as my primary desktop environment to enhance my programming skills and continuously explore new technologies. Throughout my academic journey, I've developed strong teamwork and leadership abilities, contributing as much as possible in areas where I have less experience while embracing each challenge as a learning opportunity. On the other hand, when I'm more knowledgeable about a topic I naturally take on a leadership role, guiding my team and driving progress. I approach challenges with a positive and level-headed mindset, always striving to find the best possible solution, which has led me to participate in competitive programming, take on leadership roles in clubs, and manage project areas. These experiences have further shaped my passion for coding and reinforced my commitment to pursuing a career in computer science.</p>
